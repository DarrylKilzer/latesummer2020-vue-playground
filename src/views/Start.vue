        <h5>How to use this Playground</h5>
        <p>After completing each built out challenge, see if you can add on to it and find different ways to utilize
          what you just learned. This application is meant to be progressive, meaning in general the problems should be
          tackled from left to right. In many cases you will need to combine the knowledge you learned from the
          previous tabs. Those tools will be used in the next tabs and there will be an assumed knowledge base, meaning
          you will see them in use but we will not discuss how they work.</p>
